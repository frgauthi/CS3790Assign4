FAT Filesystem Assignment 4 for CS3790
Author: Frankie Gauthier

COMPILE
--------

-to compile this program type "make cat dir delete format" in the CS3790Assign4 directory

type 	./format to create a filesystem file
	
	./dir to view the filesystem, which is initially created with one file called frank
	
	./cat frank will show you the contents of the frank file

	./delete will delete the frank file from the filesystem directory and the FAT


*I wasn't able to get to the copy command and my other commands work in a limited way, I got stuck trying to have my delete command overwrite the Floppy.mfs properly. If I opened it with O_RDWR and wrote back to the file it would have no effect. When I used my ./dir after so I am using it with O_RDWR and O_TRUNC but when I do that my fat and directory values seem to be wiped, but at least if you use ./dir after the directory entry dissappears.
